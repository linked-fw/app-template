/**
 * Who may query the example data (the home page's Person list) through the
 * generic query plane: the endpoints that run a query the client built, such
 * as `/call/@_linked/server/createQuery`.
 *
 * Without a rule, the server requires a session for every write, and for every
 * read once `rpcExposure` is `'enforce'`. This template has no sign-in, so the
 * home page form would answer `401 Authentication required`. The rule built
 * here is attached to the app's store in `linked.backend.storage.ts` with
 * `withAccess`, and it is deliberately narrow:
 *
 * - a signed-in session may run any query, as the default `'session'` rule
 *   allows;
 * - without a session, a query may READ only the example shapes, in every
 *   environment;
 * - without a session, a query may WRITE the example shapes only when
 *   `NODE_ENV` is exactly `development` (what `.env.example` sets for
 *   `npm start`). A production build (`npm run build` / `serve-app`, which run
 *   with `NODE_ENV=production`) and an unset `NODE_ENV` refuse anonymous
 *   writes;
 * - any query that touches a shape outside the example falls back to
 *   requiring a session.
 *
 * Remove the rule together with the example, or replace it with your own
 * rules once the app has sign-in. Note that a rule belongs to a store, not to a
 * shape: a query the rule admits can address any node in that store's dataset
 * by id, as long as it does so through the example shapes. That is acceptable
 * for disposable example data in development, and it is why the anonymous
 * write is kept out of production.
